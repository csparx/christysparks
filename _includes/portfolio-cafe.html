After redesigning the website, sales greatly increased as well as traffic to their website. Over the years, the small ecommerce website has evolved into a website for digital magazines, streaming media, etc.  </p><p>I created the website using Wordpress. The homepage, pictured above, features the newest issue of the Café Racer Magazine with a right column containing the featured instagram feed and search bar. The newest sale is highlighted above with a banner.</p></div><div class="screenshot"><a href="assets/img/portfolio/caferacer/cr-swag.jpg" data-lightbox="caferacer"><img src="assets/img/portfolio/caferacer/cr-swag.jpg"/></a></div><div class="description"><p>The picture above showcases the general product page.
