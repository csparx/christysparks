    title: Career Profile
    text: 'I have worked at my current company, Hatton-Brown Publishers, for the past ten years. Once I started working at Hatton-Brown Publishers, I was taught the fundamentals of Wordpress, PHP, and Javascript. I managed to quickly teach myself several additional web based coding languages which I utilized to create and manage over 16 different websites for the company. My skills allowed me to create a new subdivision for Hatton-Brown, HB Media. This subdivision is responsible for developing websites for small businesses in the industry.
          <br><br>Throughout my time working with Hatton-Brown Publishers, I have gained valuable experience brainstorming new ideas with team members, learning new tasks efficiently, analyzing/improving past business processes and working with editors to create innovative digital media. I continued to further my education while working full time, and in the summer of 2015 I graduated from Troy University with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. 
          <br><br>During my career as a web developer, I have worked remotely for several companies. I am currently working remotely for Café Racer Magazine. I created an ecommerce website for Café Racer Magazine in 2012 and over the course of five years, have developed several new functionalities for the website. These new functions included magazine subscriptions with automatic renewals, digital magazine subscriptions with embedded interactive layouts, and streaming video of Café Racer TV.'
