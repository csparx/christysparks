Advertisers from the company's publication, Southern Loggin' Times, would need to be able to purchase a membership and create their own used equipment listings. The platform needed to be able to be maintained using a content management system.</p><p>I created the website using Wordpress, creating a theme from scratch. The homepage, pictured above, features a slider with a column of search options embedded. Visitors can search listings posted by category, make, model, and price.</p></div></div></section>
